The accompanying ceremonies were put in place to commemorate the moment and to celebrate the themes of each previous edition of la Fête. (Just to be clear, the ceremonies were not of religious/spiritual nature). They were, according to many participants, the best part of la Fête and a great opportunity to connect with each other as well as express our creativity. Beyond being a drunken fancy dress party, the ceremonies are a ritualized, theatralised moment to partake in, a living embodiment of la Fête’s values and the manifestation of joy of creating/constructing something magical together. The more you let yourself go, the grander and more magical the ceremony will be for everyone.",

As last year, spontaneous orgies are encouraged (not really kidding lol), but we want everyone to feel safe, well and comfortable during the party. Consent is key – ask for explicit (verbal or nonverbal) permission to touch and engage with others and in the absence of clear, enthusiastic yes, assume it means no. We trust and love all our guests but as the rape culture is unfortunately not a thing of the past yet, we want to make sure everyone is feeling that their boundaries are respected at all times. For that purpose, we are appointing several consent & welfare officers (names TBC) and if you are in doubt re: anything or something/someone made you uneasy, come see us. (For those who haven’t attended the party last year and might worry after reading this - last year we had zero problems of that kind, but we would still rather be #safenotsorry.)"

For that purpose, we have appointed two Leave no Trace Leads - names TBCl. We trust you are perfectly capable of recycling and sorting out your trash as appropriate but whenever in doubt, our leads are there to enlighten you."

Gifting with generosity is far from everyday consumerism we encounter and a first step towards utopia and wonderful encounters. As this requires effort on everyone’s side, do not hesitate to prepare little gifts for others in advance and/or putting yourself in the mindset of giving and receiving. As organizers, we do not expect any gifts whatsoever: we consider that your participation, time, energy and money (as everyone is paying for their stay & food), will be the most wonderful gift ever."

The party is designated not only as a great way to mark the occasion, but also as a mini utopia/social experiment, where we will be exploring different, freer ways of being. However, some of us harbour political and other future ambition/have serious jobs (lol) that could be fucked up with the unapproved videos popping on the Internet in 5 years’ time. So no photo should be taken without the person’s consent (common sense encouraged) and nothing, absolutely nothing should go on the internet without checking in with everyone on the photo first. We trust our guests, nobody is signing an NDA, let’s keep this consent-centric behaviour on all fronts."

If you need anything, come ask those you feel safe with. If you want some cuddles, come forward. We will kindly assume everyone knows how to look after themselves and when to ask for help/support/advice/whatever."
